# Demo

To run the front end part of the demo just install and run. The demo runs on a publicly available server so just the front end needs run.

* Demo server available publicly at https://api-demo.websanova.com
* Demo server on GitHub https://github.com/websanova/laravel-api-demo
* Change the http options root in the `app.js` demo file to a different server for personal testing.

The demos are in separate folders to make it simpler to test standalone side by side.

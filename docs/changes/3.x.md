# 3.x Change Log

If you are still on 2.x please visit the (very short) [2.x to 3.x Upgrade Guide].


## 3.0.x

Potential breaking changes:

* There are no more success/error callback functions, instead use a promise.
* No more underscore prefix on driver functions. This applies to `http` and `router` drivers.
* The `$auth.ready()` no longer accept a callback function, use `$auth.load().then()` promise instead.
* Everything changed to proper es6 module imports (check this)


Demos:

* The 2.x demo has been updated to use vue-cli and should work much better as standalone demo now.
* A Vuex sample module has been included in the 2.x demo.

Additions:


Fixes:

* Fix for `SameSite` cookie warnings which is now set to `SameSite=None` to allow for CORS.


Docs:

* This has (hopefully) been greatly improved with more specific sections to what seem to have been common pain points.
*

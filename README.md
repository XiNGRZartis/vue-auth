# Vue Auth

Vue.js token based authentication plugin. Supports simple token based and Json Web Tokens (JWT) authentication.


## Notes

* There should not be too many non-breaking changes, so the versioning has continued from the previous package.


## Demo

To run the front end part of the demo just install and run.

```
> sudo npm install
> sudo npm run demo
```

For the backend a path to the demo file needs to be set to. If a different path is required it must be set in the `demo/app.js` file.
